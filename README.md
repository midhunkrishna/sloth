Sloth is a collection of helpers. A whole bunch of methods defined on ruby's inbuilt classes, just so you can code away without taking the pain of, say:  
  * removing every empty string literals from an array.
  * check whether that string is a valid json.
  * get all the values of a key in a hash or
  * check if a string is a valid email.

**Sloth** was born out of boredom. The need to write same code snippets over and over again. If you would like to add a method/helper that you think would be useful to others as well, please do send a pull request.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sloth-rb'
